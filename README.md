# Sarvesh Mishra

I build reliable web and automation solutions that deliver clear outcomes. My work covers backend services, full stack web development, automation tooling and systems utilities. I write maintainable code and focus on practical results that recruiters and engineering teams can evaluate quickly.

## Quick summary for recruiters
1. Primary focus is Python for automation, web scraping, backend services and data utilities.  
2. Web development with TypeScript and JavaScript across frontend and server-side applications.  
3. Strong foundation in HTML and CSS for responsive interfaces and landing pages.  
4. Experience with MySQL, MongoDB and Firebase for storage, realtime workflows and hosting.  
5. Systems and low-level work with C and Java for performance-focused utilities and foundational learning.  
6. Tooling and platforms include Git and GitHub for source control, Docker for containers, Flask for lightweight APIs, Selenium and BeautifulSoup for scraping and automation.  
7. Strengths are shipping reliable features, automating repetitive workflows and building clear APIs with pragmatic engineering.
